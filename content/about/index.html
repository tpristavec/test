<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p>I’m a sociologist and a postdoctoral research associate in the Social and Decision Analytics Division of the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at the University of Virginia (phew – UVA BII SDAD for short). My doctoral research focused on statistical methods and the sociology of health, families, and the life course. At SDAD, I collaborate with an interdisciplinary research group using quantitative methods on multiple data sources to develop evidence-based research and inform effective decision-making in government and industry.</p>
<p>I enjoy experimenting in R, sprouting and watching plants grow, <a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/tejapristavec">flying</a>, all sorts of physical activity, and good green tea.</p>
