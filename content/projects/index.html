<h1>Dissertation</h1>
<p>My dissertation, titled <em><a href="http://sociology.rutgers.edu/graduate/works-in-progress/dissertations-in-progress">Three Essays on the Caregiving Experience: Informal Caregivers’ Perception of Burden and Benefits, the Importance of Coping Resources, and How Caregiver Experience Matters for Care Recipients</a></em>, addressed three gaps in our current knowledge on the benefits and burden of informal caregiving to US older adults. It examined what constitutes the informal caregiving experience, how coping resources modify the experience, and how caregivers’ experiences matter for care recipient outcomes. I combined two datasets—the National Health and Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving—and employed regression and latent class analysis techniques to analyze data from a nationally representative sample of over 2,200 informal caregiver and older adult care recipient pairs. My findings, generalizable to the population of informal caregivers to US older persons, can inform policy and interventions aimed at improving both caregiver and care recipient outcomes.</p>
