<p>“I liked how organized Teja was with presenting the materials. The instructional videos used were extremely helpful and it was great that she took the time to find them. The videos really helped clear up confusing concepts. Teja also did a really excellent job answering questions in a clear and concise manner. She made the material relevant to us and really cared about us understanding the material. She really tried to simply confusing concepts to help us understand.” (CST, S15)</p>
<p>“Teja, overall, was very approachable and was always ready to do her best when it came to teaching, providing assistance, or responding via e-mail.” (CST, F15)</p>
<p>“The instructor was always prepared and seemed to really value helping us learn the material. She was able to break it down into simple parts, making the recitation often more useful than the lecture.” (CST, F15)</p>
