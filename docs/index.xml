      <description>Hi! I’m a sociologist and a postdoctoral research associate in the Social and Decision Analytics Division of the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at the University of Virginia (phew – UVA BII SDAD for short).

It examined what constitutes the informal caregiving experience, how coping resources modify the experience, and how caregivers’ experiences matter for care recipient outcomes.</description>

I have a strong interest in quantitative analysis and am eager to develop competency in new techniques, programming languages, and to further my knowledge of workflow, collaboration, and reproducible research tools.
Training I am proficient in R, Stata, Mplus, Git, bash, and LaTeX.
